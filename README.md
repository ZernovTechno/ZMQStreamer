## About
Hey! This is my software used to broadcast the screen via the MJPG protocol. The code runs in Python, and takes a screenshot every N times (As fast as possible).

## How it works?
Simple. For using on a Windows/in a "Release mode" you can just run .exe file. There are three different resolutions:

If your screen 21:9 or something else - it just resize it, and compress.

## Basicly it working with my [Unity AR app for Android](https://github.com/ZernovTechno/AR)
